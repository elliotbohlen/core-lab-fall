I used group 4s outline to follow for my pages. The index links to page 1 if you chose to water the plant and also page 2 if you chose to not. On page 1 you can either water the plant more which leads to it being overwatered and dying (page 5), or you can go propogate it and create more plants (page 3). On page 2 you can continue to not water it and have it die from dehydration (page 5) or you can save your plant with water going to page 4.
